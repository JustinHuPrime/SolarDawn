          <h1>Solar Dawn Guide</h1>
          <p>
            Solar Dawn is a 4X digital board game featuring simultaneous turn
            resolution as you fly modular spacecraft around a hex-grid board.
          </p>
          <p>
            You play as one of up to six nations racing to industrialize space.
            Your goal is to become the dominant power in space by controlling
            the majority of the industrial power in the system, whether through
            peaceful growth or violent destruction.
          </p>
          <h2>The Board</h2>
          <p>
            The game board is a hex grid, where the distance from the center of
            one hex to the center of any other hex represents 0.1 AU. The exact
            layout of the board can vary by scenario. For the default campaign
            board, it is a stylized recreation of the solar system (as in, only
            vaguely accurate positioning of celestial bodies).
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard campaign board consists of the sun, eight planets,
            seventeen moons, and many asteroids and kuiper belt objects, with
            more ore-bearing bodies closer to the sun and more water-bearing
            bodies further from the sun.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mercury and Venus can be landed on to mine for ore</li>
            <li>
              The Earth can't be landed on at all, but you can only build
              habitats while in orbit of Earth
            </li>
            <li>The Moon can be landed on to mine for water and ore</li>
            <li>Mars can be landed on to mine for water and ore</li>
            <li>Phobos and Deimos can be rendezvoused with to mine for ore</li>
            <li>
              The asteroid belt can be rendezvoused with to mine for ore, and
              sometimes for water
            </li>
            <li>
              The four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, can
              have fuel skimmed from them while in orbit
            </li>
            <li>
              The fourteen moons of the gas giants can be landed on to mine for
              water and often also for ore
            </li>
            <li>
              The kuiper belt can be rendezvoused with to mine for water and
              sometimes for ore
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Sequence of Play</h2>
          <p>
            Each round is split into three phases - logistics, combat, and
            movement. During each phase, you and your opponents will give orders
            to your spacecraft stacks which will be simultaneously resolved,
            before looping back around to the logistics phase to start the next
            turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the logistics phase you can move modules between rendezvoused
            stacks, make new stacks, move resources within and between
            rendezvoused stacks, mine and refine resources, repair, salvage, and
            build modules, and attempt to board undefended modules.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the combat phase, you can shoot your guns at targets and arm
            warheads.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the movement phase, you can conduct engine burns, orbital
            rendezvouses, landings, and take-offs. At the end of this phase,
            objects move according to their velocity and update their velocities
            based on the gravity effects of nearby bodies.
          </p>
          <h2>Modules and Stacks</h2>
          <p>
            Your units are rocket stacks, each of which consists of some number
            of modules in no particular structure. Stacks move together, share
            resources, and take damage as a group. Stacks can only be split or
            combined during the logistics phase.
          </p>
          <h3>Modules</h3>

          <h2>Combat</h2>
          <p>There are three means of damaging enemy spacecraft:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You can shoot at them with guns, although this is incredibly
              ineffective at ranges greater than a single hex. A single gun
              deals one point of damage on a successful hit, but the hit rate
              goes down by half (from 100%) per hex of range.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can hit them with a warhead, either in a stack of its own or
              in a stack with other modules, like a fuel tank and an engine.
              Warheads deal damage equal to one third (rounded up) of the number
              of modules on each ship hit, and can hit multiple ships at once.
              Warheads are the primary means of dealing damage to enemy ships,
              but can be dodged or shot down, depending on how you construct
              your missile stack. Warheads have a damage radius of just over
              half a hex, and will detonate the instant an enemy stack is within
              range.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can manoeuver them into a planet. This instantly destroys the
              stack and leaves behind no debris. This is, however, exceedingly
              difficult to achieve against stacks with even minimal engine
              thrust.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When taking damage, first: intact armour plates are damaged into
            damaged armour plates per point of damage until no intact plates
            remain or all damage has been assigned. Second: non-destroyed
            modules are randomly selected to take damage per point of damage
            remaining, converting intact modules into damaged modules and
            damaged modules into destroyed modules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Damaged modules can be repaired into intact modules at the cost of ⅒
            of the module's mass by a habitat or a factory during the logistics
            phase. Destroyed modules, however, can only be scrapped for
            materials equivalent to ½ of the module's mass by a factory during
            the logistics phase. Note that a destroyed or damaged module still
            masses the same as an intact module.
          </p>
          <h2>The Economy</h2>
          <p>
            There are two main resource cycles in the game. First, your stacks
            mine ore, which is refined into materials, which is turned into
            modules to upgrade stacks. Second, your stacks mine water which is
            refined into fuel (or you skim fuel directory) which is used to move
            your stacks around.
          </p>
          <h2>Orders</h2>
          <p></p>
          <h2>Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            Your goal in the default scenario is to control the majority of the
            victory points on the board. You can achieve this both by building
            more things that grant victory point as well by destroying or
            capturing things that grant victory points from your opponents.
          </p>
          <h3>Ship Design</h3>
          <p>
            The with how powerful engines are, the rocket equation is not
            tyrannical, but it is still mildly unpleasant. A ship that doesn't
            drop any tanks has a theoretical maximum Δv of 60 hex/turn. This can
            be extended further by staging, but this would lead to exponentially
            increasing stack sizes.
          </p>
